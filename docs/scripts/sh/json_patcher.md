# json_patcher.sh

## Overview

`json_patcher.sh` is a wrapper script that runs the JSON patcher Python script. It navigates to the project root and executes `json_patcher.py`.

## Purpose

- Convenient wrapper for `json_patcher.py`
- Sets correct working directory
- Provides simple execution interface
- Shows project root information

## How It Works

1. **Directory Navigation**: Changes to project root
2. **Script Execution**: Runs `python3 scripts/py/json_patcher.py`
3. **Status Display**: Shows completion message

## Usage

### Basic Usage

```bash
cd scripts/sh
bash json_patcher.sh
```

### From Project Root

```bash
bash scripts/sh/json_patcher.sh
```

## What It Does

Executes the JSON patcher which:
- Finds PublisherApp files
- Matches them with JSON scenario files
- Replaces hardcoded data with JSON reading code

## Execution Order

**Important**: Run after `idl_patcher.py`:
1. First: `idl_patcher.py` - Creates AUTOGENERATED blocks
2. Then: `json_patcher.py` - Replaces blocks with JSON reading

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- `json_patcher.py` must exist
- JSON files in `scenarios/` directory
- IDL patcher must be run first

## Integration

Can be used:
- Standalone after IDL patcher
- As part of manual workflow
- Alternative to running Python script directly

## Notes

- Simple wrapper script
- Sets project root automatically
- Waits for user input before closing
- Must run after IDL patcher
